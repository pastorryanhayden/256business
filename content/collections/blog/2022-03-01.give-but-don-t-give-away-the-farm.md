        text: 'Recently, I got to interview the great Melissa Harden.  If you don''t know Melissa, she owns a photography studio in Mattoon and she pours an incredible amount of effort into our local business community. (I wouldn''t be doing this podcast if she hadn''t invited me to speak at a business  meet up, and shown me how much fun it is to spend time with other local business owners.)'

        text: 'I love teaching, coaching and connecting with entrepreneurs.  One of the greatest parts of my business is that I get to meet so many of them and get a peek behind the curtain at what they do.  I try to be very generous with my time and genuinely want to help people succeed in business...BUT if you hire my company for a website or a web app, you will get charged a fair price.  I can''t give that away, my kids need to eat.  My employees need to pay their mortgages.'
